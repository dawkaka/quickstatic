## Priorities 

A QuickStatic site should show the content first, and hide themes or configuration details. We spend more time writing content than editing website templates and configs. We should lean into features in markdown, such as directives and custom attributes, for adding features and components to markdown, instead of supporting MDX. QuickStatic generates static websites and focuses on doing that in a flexible and fast way. This project prioritizes the following tenets:

- Simplicity.
- Stability (few featuresâ€”and should not change very much).
- Content first. 
- Super flexible markdown, via extended markdown specifications.
- Never support MDX (React in markdown). Instead, depend on markdown directives and the markdown attributes extended spec.
- No asset management or SCSS or LESS or any other automated transpiler support. 
- Build on top of Shopify liquid templates. 
- Prioritize productivity.

## Installation

QuickStatic can be installed (and updated) using the `cargo` command below (if you don't have Rust Cargo installed already, you should read the [Cargo Installation Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) and install it).

```
cargo install quickstatic
```

## Basic Usage

Some quick tips to note:

- Quickstatic themes should be under `_quickstatic/themes/` directory.
- Quickstatic public or build directory is `quickstatic/public`.
- Everything in the root directory gets copied into the output directory in that order, while markdown files are compiled into HTML files.
- Anything with a `.liquid` extension is executed as a template and the `.liquid` extension is striped. For example, `sitemap.xml.liquid` would be evaluated and become `sitemap.xml`.

<br />

To build the site, kindly run the command below:

```
quickstatic build
```

To watch for changes and continuously rebuild the site, kindly run the command below:

```
quickstatic serve
```

For all options and commands, kindly run the command below:

```
quickstatic --help
```

## Themes and Templates 

QuickStatic themes can be written using the [Shopify liquid templating language](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers). To use any given template file for a particular page, simply reference the template file from the frontmatter. For example:

```markdown
---
title: Page title
layout: themeName/blog/index.liquid
---

Page Content.
```

This is flexible and allows you to reference multiple themes from one QuickStatic site.

> [!TIP]
> 
> All themes exist in the `_quickstatic/themes/` folder and your QuickStatic site comes with a default theme named `default`.
